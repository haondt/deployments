# Abuse the map directive (see <https://stackoverflow.com/q/14433309>) to ensure

#     $proxy_connection is resolved.
#   - The $proxy_connection variable is used in a proxy_set_header directive in
#     the http block, so it is always fully resolved for every request -- even                                                                                                                                                #     those where proxy_pass is not used (e.g., unknown virtual host).
